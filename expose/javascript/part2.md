1.It will print 3, the value of prices.length
2.It will print 150, the final value of discountedPrice
3.It will print 150, the final value of finalPrice
4.It will return the array [50, 100, 150]
5.Error becaue i is not in the scope of the statement
6.Error because the scope of discountedPrice is just the for statement
7.It will return 0
8.It will return an empty array
9.Error because i is not in the scope of the statement
10.It will return 3, the value of prices.length
11.Error because you are trying to change the count discounte
12.a.student.name
   b.student["Grad Year"]
   c.student.greeting()
   d.student["Favorite Teacher"].name
   e.student.course[0]
13.a."32", 2 becomes a string and is concatenated to 3
   b.1, 3 becomes an int so it is just 3-2
   c.3, null is 0
   d."3null", null becomes a string and is concatenated to 3
   e.4, true is 1 so it is 1+3
   f.0, false becomes 0 and null becomes 0
   g.NaN, you can't do math with undefined
   H.NaN, you can't do math with undefined

14.a.True, '2' becomes 2 so 2 > 1
   b.True, becomes 2 < 12
   c.True, becomes 2 == 2
   d.False, under a strict check false because different objects
   e.False, true beomes 1 so 1 != 2
   f.True, because is the same object
15.== operator does type conversion, then evaluates. === operator does not, compares objects

16.for(const prop in statistics) {
    if($statistics[prop][0] == "r") {
        console.log($statistics[prop]);
    }
}

17.13 will return a new array with [2,4,6]. Because you passed in doSomething as the parameter for your callback function, the modifyArray takes each number in the original array, passes it into the doSomething function, which multiplies it by 2, and then pushes it into a new array. The method finally returns the whole array.
